Our healthcare database will:
1. Provide patients’ information including past medical records, and allergic history.
2. Help patients to find out useful real-time information including contact information of provider and their services.
3. Enable physicians, pharmacists, and others to track prescribed medications and to report adverse drug reactions.
4. Help providers to find information of particular value in database, to help them improve their services.

We designed database using Visual Studio to create ERD with Crow’s foot notation, and developed Database Management System by using Microsoft SQL Server for health care, which has 14 tables with 10 data entries for each table. Futhermore, the database has stored procedures, functions, and views to update the data periodically and to increase the efficiency of the information retrieval.

In addition, using PowerBI, the BI tools to generate report for data visualization.
